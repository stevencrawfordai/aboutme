Hi, I’m Steven Crawford!
I transitioned from a career in marketing to pursue my passion for programming and cutting-edge technologies. I'm particularly interested in AI, machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and other emerging tech that is shaping the future. I’m continuously learning and exploring new ways to innovate with AI and tech solutions.
Feel free to check out my projects and follow along as I explore and contribute to the exciting world of technology!
